### Remarks
The data and information are shared by my friends who interviewed with Revolut.<br>
*Background*: Fraud case is expected to be found form the given dataset<br>
*What I've done*:<br>
1. Quick data cleansing
2. Upsampling the fraud case
3. XGBoost has been used to sort out fraud cases
*Points to note*: Since my friend does not provide full detail on the interview questions, including the testing set. Although the accuracy seems to be high, it is because no new dataset has been tested. Ideally, there should be an extra set of data to see the actual performance.
